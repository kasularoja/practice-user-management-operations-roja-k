# SQL User Management Practice
Practice-1:
In this exercise, I practiced using SQL to manage user data. I wrote queries to insert, update, delete, and select users from a database. This helped me understand how developers interact with databases in real-world applications.

The most challenging part was remembering when and how to use the WHERE clause to avoid unintended updates or deletions.
